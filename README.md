# JUnit Testing With TDD. 

The purpes of this project is to understand and learn TDD(Test Driven Development) by constructing the projects using both unit tests and mockito. The way this project worked is by first creating a test with a red commit, then writing enough code for the test to pass, then commiting the change with the title green, and lastly rewrite the code with the rest of the necessary code. 

One of the results of constructing the application using this strategy is amount of code it took to create is was far less than what would it usually does. This means that the need to create unecessary code was eliminated and the chances of getting bugs or major problems in the software was greatly reduced.
